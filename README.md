#### Update [17/03/25 00:40]
Post Checkpoint 1 Deadline Review: In the demo videos above, we forgot to update many of the input modalities fully (uses "select" for multimodal and "hover" for unimodel), which resulted in unexpected/missing behaviour for around half of the inputs. When testing individually, each modality and function worked; however when we created the inputs for the demo, we failed to replace some of the duplicated values. We unfourtunetly didn't have enough time remaining to catch and remedy this mistake.
